Content security policy (CSP) is a browser mechanism that aims to mitigate the impact of cross-site scripting and some other vulnerabilities.
If an application that employs CSP contains XSS-like behavior, then the CSP might hinder or prevent exploitation of the vulnerability. 
Often, the CSP can be circumvented to enable exploitation of the underlying vulnerability.
