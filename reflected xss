cross site scripting contexts

1. xss betwenn tags
when xss is between tags we can directlya dd our paylaod as is would not require us to bypass anything as such
this may include 
I simple payload like alert to test the presence of xss
IIwhen most of the tags are blocked we may be able to use bruteforce to find the trags and their attributes taht can be allowed 
and then use those to perform xss attack
III when all tags are blocaked exept for custom tags then we may need to create our own payload   -----> most importrant
