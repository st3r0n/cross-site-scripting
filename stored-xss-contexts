1.XSS between HTML tags
when it is in html tags we can directly iinclude out script inside it without any need for bypass etc


2.XSS inside html tag attribute -----> or data will be set to value of any of the attributes of html tags so wen nned to get out of it
for whis either we can clode the tag and add " or ' 
OR
we can find some evrnt that could trigger our code where we can insert the malicious js 
eg i---->     "><script>alert(document.domain)</script>                 here suppose we have code like
value="user input ">   so it becomes     vaule=""><script>alert(document.domain)</script>">   --> which will bypass 
eg ii ----> " autofocus onfocus=alert(document.domain) x="
