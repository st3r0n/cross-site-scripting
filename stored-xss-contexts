1.XSS between HTML tags
when it is in html tags we can directly iinclude out script inside it without any need for bypass etc


2.XSS inside html tag attribute -----> or data will be set to value of any of the attributes of html tags so wen nned to get out of it
for whis either we can clode the tag and add " or ' 
OR
we can find some evrnt that could trigger our code where we can insert the malicious js 
eg i---->     "><script>alert(document.domain)</script>                 here suppose we have code like
value="user input ">   so it becomes     vaule=""><script>alert(document.domain)</script>">   --> which will bypass 
eg ii ----> " autofocus onfocus=alert(document.domain) x="


when we have href ytag we can include xss like javascript:function or code we wan to include
eg javascript:alert()



3. xss in javascipt
i terminatinf existing script ---> when out input goes to any script we can break out of it usnin </script>
ii breaking js stirng literal ------> ehat if our input goes to any string in javascript ----> we can use someting like '-alert(document.domain)-'      OR     ';alert(document.domain)//



4. making use of html encoding  ----> sometimes we want to break out of javascript context but character like ' or " are blocked so we can use html encoding to bypass such things 
examples are:

<a href="#" onclick="... var input='controllable data here'; ...">
then we can break out as 
&apos;-alert(document.domain)-&apos;    ----> here we used html encoding to use ' character
